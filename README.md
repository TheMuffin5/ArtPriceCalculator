# ArtPriceCalculator
App for determining the price artists should list on their art.
This project was made using python and the library Tkinter. Tkiter is a python library for creating simple GUI's.
When you click the Save button the program will create (if it has not been already) a txt file that has all of the prices you have saved. You can also put in your own prices in the txt file and they will show in the app when you refresh the show saved button.
